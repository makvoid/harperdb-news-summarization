## Here we can define any tables in our database. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available in the REST and other external protocols.
type Entry @table @export {
    id: ID @primaryKey
    author: String!
    title: String!
    link: String!
    date: Int! @indexed # We'll store the dates as unix timestamps
    description: String!
    summary: String!
}
